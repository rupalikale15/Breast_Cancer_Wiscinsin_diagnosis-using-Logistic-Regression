#Breast-Cancer-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

📌 Overview This project applies machine learning techniques to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant. Early detection of breast cancer can significantly increase the chances of successful treatment, and this project aims to assist in that by building a predictive model.

🚀 Algorithms Used
 1.Support Vector Machine (SVM)   
 2.Random Forest Classifier
 3.Logistic Regression

🛠️ Technologies & Libraries
1.Python 
2.scikit-learn 
3.pandas 
4.numpy 
5.matplotlib 
6.seaborn

📈 Results Achieved ~96% accuracy on the test dataset.
