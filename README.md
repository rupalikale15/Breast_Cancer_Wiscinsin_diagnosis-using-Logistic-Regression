#Breast-Cancer-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
📌 Overview This project applies machine learning techniques to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant. Early detection of breast cancer can significantly increase the chances of successful treatment, and this project aims to assist in that by building a predictive model.

🚀 Algorithms Used
    Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    Random Forest Classifier
    Logistic Regression

🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Python scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

📈 Results Achieved ~96% accuracy on the test dataset.
